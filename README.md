# R-Final-Project
The R material we covered during the summer was condensed into a large final project. 
We were given a large amount of IMDB info on movie ratings and reviewers. 
From these we were tasked with getting a handle on a variety of different aspects of the data in addition to producing 
a presentation that lends some additional insight into the data and perhaps provides more information about predictions
that can be made. We decided to do our extra analysis on the rating behavior of different age demographics both as a 
whole and across different movie genres.
